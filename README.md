## Character Creation

When creating a new character, you’ll need to make the following decisions:

- **Name**: Choose a name for your character.
- **Gender**: Select your character’s gender.
- **Height**: Enter the height of your character (in cm).
- **Class**: Choose between **Fighter**, **Mage**, or **Rogue**.
    - **Fighter**: Starts with higher Strength, better at physical combat.
    - **Mage**: Starts with higher Magic, able to cast powerful spells.
    - **Rogue**: Starts with higher Luck, better at sneaking and luck-based events.
- **Stats Allocation**: You will have 21 points to allocate across the following stats:
    - **Strength**: Affects attack power and physical combat abilities.
    - **Magic**: Affects mana and the ability to cast spells.
    - **Constitution**: Increases health, making your character more durable.
    - **Charisma**: Helps in NPC interactions and conversation-based events.
    - **Luck**: Increases the chance of favorable random events.

### How to Allocate Stats

To allocate your stats, you will enter a series of numbers separated by spaces. Each number corresponds to a stat, where:

- **1 = Strength**
- **2 = Charisma**
- **3 = Magic**
- **4 = Constitution**
- **5 = Luck**

You must use exactly 21 points in total, and each number represents 1 point allocated to the corresponding stat. For example:

- **1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4** would allocate:
  - 3 points to **Strength** (1s)
  - 2 points to **Charisma** (2s)
  - 2 points to **Magic** (3s)
  - 1 point to **Constitution** (4)
  - 0 points to **Luck** (no 5s)

In this case, you've used all 21 points, and no points are left.

- Another valid example could be: **1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 4** which would allocate:
  - 5 points to **Strength** (5 ones)
  - 4 points to **Charisma** (4 twos)
  - 2 points to **Magic** (2 threes)
  - 1 point to **Constitution** (1 four)
  - 0 points to **Luck** (no fives)

### Example Allocation:
- If you type `1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4`, this will allocate 3 points to **Strength**, 2 points to **Charisma**, 2 points to **Magic**, and 1 point to **Constitution**. You will have no points remaining for **Luck**.

Ensure that the total points allocated add up to exactly 21, and the stats will be updated accordingly.
